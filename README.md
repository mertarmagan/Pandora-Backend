# The Pandora's Backend Development
The repository for Pandora's backend side development. (Currently working with ExpressJS, NodeJS and a little bit of HTML and CSS)

## Getting Started
First let's see some guides to build our dependencies and development platform:

## NodeJS & ExpressJS

ExpressJS is a framework for working with NodeJS easily. This will handle our main server. However, we need to install NodeJS to work with ExpressJS.

### 1- Installing NodeJS
To prepare the machine for installing NodeJS:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
```
To install NodeJS:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
To check the npm's version:
```bash
npm -v 
```
