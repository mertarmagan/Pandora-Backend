# Pandora-Backend
The repository for Pandora's backend side development. (Currently working with ExpressJS, NodeJS and a little bit of HTML and CSS)

## Getting Started
First let's see some guides to build our dependencies and development platform:

### NodeJS & ExpressJS

ExpressJS is a framework for working with NodeJS easily. This will handle our main server. However, we need to install NodeJS to work with ExpressJS.

### Installing NodeJS

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
```
